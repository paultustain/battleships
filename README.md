# Battleships
Battleships CLI game made to learn about using Rust. 

I had progressed through the rust book to chapter 10 and wanted to take what I had done and build something simple in Rust to understand the way to approach Rust problems. 
The code could be made much better and built to better utilise the rust frameworks. 
Currently the CPU makes random moves. 

## Future Development
- Improve the code to actually look alright and be more organised. (This was not the aim of this project as I was focussed on the language itself.)
- Use `struct` and `impl` etc to be able to use `match` for decisions. 
- Improve the CPU with levels. So it makes more structured guesses. (Medium level would be looking around current 'X' / Hard would look around 'X' in lines and put guesses in a grid)
